# GenBPTI
Using BPTI to create a generative network
- Crossentropy loss works better
- Adding negative (random images) examples helps
- Tanh() is better than relu or prelu

seans - self adversarial generative network. 
Try with only 2 classes: (1, not 1).
Hope that this is better by training time, performance, parameters.
